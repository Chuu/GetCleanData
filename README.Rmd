Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
--------------------------------------
This is my submission for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.  Included within are the following items:

- README.md : The readme, likely the doccument you are reading now.
- run_analysis.R : Contains the core logic that transforms the source data set to the final data set
- codebook.md : The codebook for this data set

# Pre-requisites

- I am going to assume that the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder exists in your current working directory.  
- Besides that, all that is needed to run the `R` script is R itself.
